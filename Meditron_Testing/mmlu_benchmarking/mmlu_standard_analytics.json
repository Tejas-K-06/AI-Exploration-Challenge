        "truth": "A",
        "pred": "A",
        "reasoning": "Reasoning: A cannula is a small, hollow tube used to enter blood vessels for the purpose of drawing or giving blood. The diameter of a cannula (the space between the outer and inner surfaces) is measured in gauge, which is defined as the number of times the circumference of the cannula fits into that of a standard needle. For example, a 20-gauge catheter has a cannula whose diameter is two times the diameter of a 22-gauge catheter. In other words, a 18-gauge catheter would be twice as large in cross sectional area as a 24-gauge catheter (A). Therefore, we choose option A.\nAnswer: A"

The musculocutaneous nerve provides motor innervation to the biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, and subscapularis. It also supplies sensory innervation to the medial portion of the upper arm. Entrapment of the musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm is unlikely because it does not overlap with the median nerve (B). The ulnar nerve provides motor innervation to the small finger, ring finger, and part of the middle finger. Sensory innervation is supplied to all digits except the thumb.

        "pred": "A",
        "reasoning": "Reasoning: The patient has Graves' disease. This is a hyperthyroidism condition caused by autoantibodies against the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR). It causes an increase in thyroid hormone synthesis and release, leading to hypermetabolic symptoms. A defect in T4 biosynthesis would cause hypothyroidism with low serum T4 levels (B). Multinodular goiter is a benign condition caused by abnormal growth of the thyroid gland. It would not cause hyperthyroidism or increased uptake on 131I scan (C). Riedel's thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition that causes fibrosis and stiffening of the thyroid gland. It would not cause hyperthyroidism (D).\nAnswer: A"

        "truth": "B",
        "pred": "A",
        "reasoning": "Reasoning: The stone is composed primarily of calcium oxalate. Oxalate stones are caused by hypercalciuria (A). This leads to a high concentration of Ca2+ in the urine, which promotes crystal formation and growth. Sodium-potassium-chloride symport inhibitors, such as bumetanide (B), promote water excretion. Therefore, these drugs are used to dissolve stones. Osmotic diuretics, such as mannitol (D), lead to increased diuresis and dehydration. This can result in an increase in the concentration of calcium oxalate in the urine, which promotes stone formation and growth. Therefore, this drug is not appropriate for dissolving stones.\nAnswer: A"

Once the K value has been reached, the carrying capacity cif the environment remains unchanged, which suggests that zero population control is the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population (B). If the environment were changed, the K value would decrease, and therefore more mortality would be required to maintain a constant population size. Increasing the mortality rate does not directly control the mosquito population (D).\nAnswer: A"

        "pred": "C",
        "reasoning": "A frameshift mutation is created when a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one. This occurs because the genetic code uses three-base codons to specify each amino acid, and if the third base differs from the usual one, a frameshift mutation is created (A). Removal of telomeric sequences from DNA does not create a frameshift mutation (B). A base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene to create a frameshift mutation (C). Termination of translation occurs when a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid, it acts to terminate translation (D).\nAnswer: C"
