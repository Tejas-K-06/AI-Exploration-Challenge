Eradication of polio requires an integrated effort of multiple approaches such as vaccination (D), improved sanitation and hygiene (E), and antiviral drugs (G).\nAnswer: G"

        "full_response": "Reasoning: Viruses are submicroscopic, infectious agents that replicate inside living cells. They can cause disease in humans and other animals. The first viral disease of man was discovered by the Dutch microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek who observed red blood cell inclusions in his own blood samples. He is credited with the discovery of the first virus, or at least the earliest one, when he described a contagious condition among sailors (probably scurvy) onboard his ship that was transmitted by fomites and caused localized skin lesions.\nAnswer: A"

        "correct": false,
        "full_response": "Reasoning: The poliovirus replicates in human intestinal cells. Polio is spread by the fecal-oral route, and thus, virulence can be increased by altering its mode of transmission (A). Recombination with other enteroviruses increases pathogenicity (C), and multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions in the genome increase virulence. Antiviral resistance is a mechanism for resistant mutations to emerge, but poliovirus does not have antiviral resistance yet.\nAnswer: C"

They replicate via transcription, not by integrating their DNA into the host cell's genome or through binary fission (F). Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that integrate their DNA into the host cell's genome and replicate as positive strand RNA viruses.\nAnswer: C"

Palmitic acid (D), alcohol (G), glycerol (A), leucine (H), and cellulose (E) all have lower energy content than lactose or glucose, so they are incorrect answers.\nAnswer: B"
