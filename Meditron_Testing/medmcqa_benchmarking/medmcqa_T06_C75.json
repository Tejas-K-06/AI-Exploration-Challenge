        "full_response": "Confidence: 0.85\nReasoning: In the context of dental caries, \"spindles\" refers to enamel spindle-shaped crystals, which are oriented perpendicularly to the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ). The DEJ is a unique interface between the dentin and enamel. The outermost layer of enamel is very thin in humans and mammals; it consists of a single layer of prismatic cells and a single layer of ameloblasts, which are located at the DEJ. Therefore, the enamel spindles can be seen as part of the DEJ. The dentin contains collagen fibers, which run parallel to the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ). Dentinal tubules penetrate into the dentin and connect with each other at the DEJ. Therefore, the striae of Retzius are formed by the connection of the dentinal tubules in a circular pattern. The enamel lamellae are thin layers of enamel that run perpendicularly to the DEJ. They are located between the prismatic cells and the DEJ; they are often referred to as \"prism sheaths\"."
